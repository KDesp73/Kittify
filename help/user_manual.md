## Editing

If you want to edit a song's information, select and right click the 
song you want to edit from the list and press `Edit`. 
Change the information accordingly (keep in mind that the 
information might slightly change after scraping)

## Scraping

For individual scraping, select and right click the song you want to scrape 
from the list and press scrape. If `Title` and `Artist` are already 
set from metadata or from editing the song manually, the scraping 
will begin. If only the `Title` of the song is set, a dialog 
wil appear prompting you to select an artist. After that, 
the scraping will continue as usual


### Scrape All

For mass scraping go to **Api > Scrape All**. The procces will start in 
the background and you will be informed when it finished successfully

If you want to mass scrape at startup you can toggle 
it at **Api > Scrape at startup**


## No Internet Connection

If you computer is not connected to the internet scraping for information 
will not be possible. Information of already scraped songs will appear 
except for album covers that haven't been downloaded locally
