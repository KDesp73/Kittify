## Basic Troobleshooting

If you come across unexpected behaviour try closing and reopening 
the application. Another way to solve your problem might 
be re-sorting the song's list.

## Reset Database

If the issue is still not being fixed try reseting your database. 
You can do that by going to **Settings > Reset Database**

Of course you can contact me or create a Github issue (see *Issues*) 
so I can remove the bug in a future update
